# About
MDGG library adopted from Prasanna (see ~/devices/mdgg_prasanna for the original files)

## Goals: 
[x] Create a simple MDGG output and see it can be observed on an oscilliscope
[x] Add multiple signals and see if they can be detected on the oscilliscope
[x] Use the Tranlator module (in a NIM BIN) and feed an output to an output and sue the delay generation
## 
* Connect the MGDD -> Tranlation Unit -> TI and generate signals with different clock cycles
	* Can we see coincidences
	* Can we set prescalars
